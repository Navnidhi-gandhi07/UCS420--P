#Consider the following two sets, A and B, represenƟng scores of two teams in mulƟple
#matches. A = {34, 56, 78, 90} and B = {78, 45, 90, 23}
#WAP to perform the following operaƟons using set funcƟons:
#i. Find the unique scores achieved by both teams (union of sets).
#ii. IdenƟfy the scores that are common to both teams (intersecƟon of sets).
#iii. Find the scores that are exclusive to each team (symmetric difference).
#iv. Check if the scores of team A are a subset of team B, and if team B's scores are
#a superset of team A.
#v. Remove a specific score X (input by the user) from set A if it exists. If not, print
#a message saying it is not present.
